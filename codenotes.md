Hi! I'm starting this new project thinking positively. I initially wanted to use Vanilla JavaScript. Then after looking at the scope of the project, I realized that ReactJS would be a better option. I started a new repository for the React App. I'm starting to work on the organization of the pages (sections, interactivity, etc). I've taken a few notes. I know I can do this with ReactJS.
